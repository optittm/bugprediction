# train command

The tool is shipped with two simple bug prediction models. You need to train each model before you can use it:

    python main.py train --model-name bugvelocity

Of course, you need to [populate](./populate.md) the database before training the model with the metrics.

See the [list of commands](./commands.md) for other options.
